# Savings Fund Tool Developed on Core Blockchain (Testnet / Mainnet)

This tool is part of Matriz, our main project. We developed three smart contracts for our saving fund software: One to manage the decentralized application login, another to define a token for savings (staking), and a third to reward users for letting their assets generate returns.

The application was built using Hardhat for blockchain integration and React-NextJS for front-end development.

This project showcases the low transaction fees and speed of the Core network, making it an ideal foundation for Matriz's savings benefits. Core's architecture allows for high scalability, enabling our application to handle a large volume of transactions efficiently.

This project was developed as part of the **Frutal Web House Hackathon @ EthereumMexico 2024**, as a tool for our main project [Matriz](https://github.com/Matriz-Coop) for the Core DAO track.

The main project aims to provide a suscription based software that allows freelancers, entrepreneurs and startup employees, access to laboral benefits such as insurance, food allowance vouchers, saving funds, among others. 

We plan to explore integrating additional tools, such as liquidity pools, to further enhance the benefits offered by our platform. We chose Core Blockchain because of its interoperability, security, speed and low tx fees that will allow us to connect seamlessly with other DeFi and social solutions built on their ecosystem, maximizing the value we provide to our users.
